"2: Click on the \"Open Process\" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below \"File\".).\n"
"3: With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like \"00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe\" or \"0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe\". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)\n"

"\n"
"Often when you've found health of a unit or your own player, you will find that if you remove the code, it affects enemies as well.\n"
"In these cases you must find out how to distinguish between your and the enemies objects.\n"
"Sometimes this is as easy as checking the first 4 bytes (Function pointer table) which often point to a unique location for the player, and sometimes it's a team number, or a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a playername. It all depends on the complexity of the game, and your luck\n"
"\n"
"The easiest method is finding what addresses the code you found writes to and then use the dissect data feature to compare against two structures. (Your unit(s)/player and the enemies) And then see if you can find out a way to distinguish between them.\n"
"When you have found out how to distinguish between you and the computer you can inject an assembler script that checks for the condition and then either do not execute the code or do something else. (One hit kills for example)\n"
"Alternatively, you can also use this to build a so called \"Array of byte\" string which you can use to search which will result in a list of all your or the enemies players\n"
"In this tutorial I have implemented the most amazing game you will ever play.\n"
"It has 4 players. 2 Players belong to your team, and 2 Players belong to the computer. \n"

"In the previous step I explained how to use the Code finder to handle changing locations. But that method alone makes it difficult to find the address to set the values you want.\n"
"That's why there are pointers:\n"
"\n"
"At the bottom you'll find 2 buttons. One will change the value, and the other changes the value AND the location of the value.\n"
"For this step you don't really need to know assembler, but it helps a lot if you do.\n"
"\n"
"First find the address of the value. When you've found it use the function to find out what accesses this address.\n"
"Change the value again, and a item will show in the list. Double click that item. (or select and click on more info) and a new window will open with detailed information on what happened when the instruction ran.\n"
"If the assembler instruction doesn't have anything between a '[' and ']' then use another item in the list.\n"
"If it does it will say what it think will be the value of the pointer you need.\n"
"Go back to the main cheat engine window (you can keep this extra info window open if you want, but if you close it, remember what is between the [ and ] ) and do a 4 byte scan in hexadecimal for the value the extra info told you.\n"
"When done scanning it may return 1 or a few hundred addresses. Most of the time the address you need will be the smallest one. Now click on manually add and select the pointer checkbox.\n"
"\n"
"The window will change and allow you to type in the address of a pointer and a offset.\n"
"Fill in as address the address you just found.\n"
"If the assembler instruction has a calculation (e.g: [esi+12]) at the end then type the value in that's at the end. else leave it 0. If it was a more complicated instruction look at the calculation.\n"
"\n"
"example of a more complicated instruction:\n"
"[EAX*2+EDX+00000310] eax=4C and edx=00801234.\n"
"In this case EDX would be the value the pointer has, and EAX*2+00000310 the offset, so the offset you'd fill in would be 2*4C+00000310=3A8.  (this is all in hex, use calc.exe from windows in scientific mode to calculate)\n"
"\n"
"Back to the tutorial, click OK and the address will be added, If all went right the address will show P->xxxxxxx, with xxxxxxx being the address of the value you found. If thats not right, you've done something wrong.\n"
"Now, change the value using the pointer you added in 5000 and freeze it. Then click Change pointer, and if all went \n"
"right the next button will become visible.\n"

"And you could also use the pointer scanner to find the pointer to this address\n"
msgstr "\n上一步阐述了如何使用\"代码查找\"功能对付变化位置的数据地址，但这种方法往往不能达到预期的效果，\n所以我们需要学习如何利用指针。\n在本关的 Tutorial.exe 窗口下面有两个按钮，一个会改变数值，另一个不但能改变数值而且还会改变数值在内存中存储的位置。\n这一步，你不需要懂得汇编，但如果懂的话会很有帮助。\n首先找到数值的地址，然后再查找是什么改写了这个地址。\n再次改变数值，CE 便可以列出找到的汇编代码。 双击一行汇编代码（或选择它并点击\"详细信息\"）并打开\"详细信息\"窗口以显示详细的信息，用来告诉你当这个指令运行时发生了什么事情。\n如果在这条汇编指令中没看到方括号（[]）的存在，我们就应该查看下一条汇编代码的详细信息，\n如果看到了方括号，那很可能表示我们已经找到了需要的指针。\n返回到主 cheat engine 窗口 （只要你愿意，你可以保持这个额外的信息窗口为打开状态。如果你要关掉它，那么要记好方栝号中间的代码）并做一次 4 字节的扫描，扫描\"详细信息\"窗口中告诉你的一串十六进制数值。\n扫描完成时它可能返回一个或几百个地址。大多数时候你需要的地址将是最少的一个。现在点击\"手工添加地址\"按钮，并勾选\"指针\"选项。\n\"添加地址\"窗口将发生变化，多出了\"Address of Pointer（指针地址）\"和\"Offset (Hex)（偏移量(16进制)）\"的文本框，以便您键入一个指针的地址和偏移量。\n请尽量填入刚才扫描到的地址。\n如果汇编指令中的方栝号里存在计算（例如：[esi+12]）则把数值部分填在\"Offset (Hex)\"的文本框中，如果不存在，则让它保持为 0 。\n如果看上去是更复杂的计算指令的话（举例说明一下）：\n[EAX*2+EDX+00000310] eax=4C 并且 edx=00801234.\n这种情况下 EDX 便是数值的指针，而 EAX*2+00000310 则是它的偏移量, 所以你要填在\"Offset (Hex)\"的将是 2*4C+00000310=3A8。（这些都是在十六进制下计算的，你可以使用WINDOWS的计算器，在科学方式下用十六进制计算）。\n回到教程，点击\"确定\"这个地址便会加到 CE 主窗口下方的地址列表中，如果没做错，在地址栏将显示 P->xxxxxxxx，而 xxxxxxxx 和你扫描到的地址数值是一致的，如果不一致，那么可能是哪里出错了。\n现在, 改变那条指针地址的数值为 5000 并锁定它，然后点击 Tutorial.exe 窗口上的\"改变指针\"按钮，如果一切正确，\"下一步\"按钮将变为可点击状态。\n\n备注:\n你也可以使用\"指针扫描\"的方式来查找这个指针地址。"

"Code injection is a technique where you inject a piece of code into the target process, and then reroute the execution of code to go through your own written code.\n"
"\n"
"In this tutorial you'll have a health value and a button that will decrease your health by 1 each time you click it.\n"
"Your task is to use code injection to make the button increase your health by 2 each time it is clicked\n"
"\n"
"Start with finding the address and then find what writes to it.\n"
"then when you've found the code that decreases it browse to that address in the disassembler, and open the auto assembler window (ctrl+a)\n"
"There click on template and then code injection, and give it the address that decreases health (If it isn't already filled in correctly)\n"
"That will generate a basic auto assembler injection framework you can use for your code.\n"
"\n"
"Notice the alloc, that will allocate a block of memory for your code cave, in the past, in the pre windows 2000 systems, people had to find code caves in the memory(regions of memory unused by the game), but that's luckily a thing of the past since windows 2000, and will these days cause errors when trying to be used, due to SP2 of XP and the NX bit of new CPU's\n"
"\n"
"Also notice the line newmem: and originalcode: and the text \"Place your code here\"\n"
"As you guessed it, write your code here that will increase the  health with 2.\n"
"An usefull assembler instruction in this case is the \"ADD instruction\"\n"
"here are a few examples:\n"
"\"ADD [00901234],9\" to increase the address at 00901234 with 9\n"
"\"ADD [ESP+4],9\" to increase the address pointed to by ESP+4 with 9\n"
"In this case, you'll have to use the same thing between the brackets as the original code has that decreases your health\n"
"\n"
"Notice:\n"
"It is recommended to delete the line that decreases your health from the original code section, else you'll have to increase your health with 3 (you increase with 3, the original code decreases with 1, so the end result is increase with 2), which might become confusing. But it's all up to you and your programming.\n"
"\n"
"Notice 2:\n"
"In some games the original code can exist out of multiple instructions, and sometimes, not always, it might happen that a code at another place jumps into your jump instruction end will then cause unknown behavior. If that happens, you should usually look near that instruction and see the jumps and fix it, or perhaps even choose to use a different address to do the code injection from. As long as you're able to figure out the address to change from inside your injected code.\n"
